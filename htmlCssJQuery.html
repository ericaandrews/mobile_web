Add jQuery to animate the heading at the top of the webpage:
- make the font size grow and then go back to normal size and 
change the color; 
- add a border around the picture;
- create a button at the bottom of the page;
- the tasks should happen after a single click of the button;
- use jQuery for animation instead of CSS3 animation;
- no need to use color animation jQuery UI to change the color 
of the font; use the css() method and use the animate() method;

    <p>Hello, my name is Erica Andrews and I am a Computer Science major at City College of San Francisco. I have attended City College of San Francisco for at least two years and I have taken many courses. I am currently Volunteering as a Lab Aid for a student with disabilities and volunteering for various companies and non-profits. I plan to apply for the certificates offered, present what I have learned to potential employers, and show what I have learned within my portfolio.</p> 
    <p id="p">I am taking this course to learn about Mobile Web and to fufill the requirements for certificates. I have taken CS and CNIT courses before but this will be my first course on the subject of Mobile Web. I plan to learn from this course and apply what I learn to my personal projects. I also would like to apply what I learn from this course to professional assignments in the future. </p>
